# Seasons

Seasons are monthly competitive cycles that track players' performance in [ranked](./commands/battle.md#cross-server) battles.

## Rewards

At the end of every season:
- The top #6 players with 900 or more points receive a special season badge that lasts until the next season.
- The #1 ranked player with 900 or more points is crowned as the season winner and receives `500` pokecoins and `25` gems

## Refresh

Seasons refresh on the `1st` of every month at `9:30pm`. After the reset, all users with over `100` points will have their points reduced by `70%`.
