# The Glitch
What’s pokemon without a few glitches? We’ve intentionally added a way to glitch a battle and obtain a glitched pokemon. If you figure it out, don’t forget to show it off!
:::tip HINT
The glitch doesn’t involve the [/spawn](./commands/spawn.md) or [/hangmon](./commands/hangmon.md) commands.
