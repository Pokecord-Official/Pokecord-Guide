# Limits

Pokecord++ is often mistaken for a Pokémon collection bot. While spawning and catching is one of the key features, below are a few things that users should keep in mind.

## User Limits

There are set limits to the amount of items and Pokémon that a user can have. This is done to ensure efficiency and speed. Users are required to make sure that they only keep and catch the Pokémon that they need while releasing the ones that they have no use for.
:::details
- Free users are limited to `2000` Pokémon while premium users are limited to `6000` Pokémon.
- Items are limited to `500`. Item limits do not include purchased moves or items held by Pokémon.
- Users can have up to `255` pokeballs at a time.

:::danger Notice
Twice a year, accounts that stay [inactive](/commands/profile.html#last-active-status) for over `4` months are auto deleted. An automatic announcement is made about this in the official server to notify users `24` hours prior. This does not affect premium users.

## Building Your Pokémon

Pokecord++ gives players access to the complete set of Pokémon mechanics. Once a Pokémon is caught, it can be enhanced through breeding, EV training, and the use of items like Nature Mints, Tera Shards, Dynamax Candies, and more to transform it into the "perfect Pokémon."
