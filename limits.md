# Limits

Pokecord++ is often mistaken for a pokemon collection bot. While spawning and catching is one of the key features, there are a few things that users should keep in mind.

## User Limits

There are set limits to the amount of items and pokemon that a user can have. This is done to ensure efficiency and speed. Users are required to make sure that they only keep and catch the pokemon that they need while releasing the ones that they have no use for.
:::details
- Free users are limited to `2000` pokemon while premium users are limited to `6000` pokemon.
- Items are limited to `500`. Item limits do not include purchased moves or items held by pokemon.
- Users can have up to `255` pokeballs at a time.

:::danger Notice
Twice a year, accounts that stay [inactive](/commands/profile.html#last-active-status) for over `4` months are auto deleted unless premium is active. An automatic announcement is made about this in the official server to notify users `24` hours prior.

## Building Your Pokemon

Pokecord++ unlocks the entirety of pokemon mechanics for the user. There is a lot that can be done with a pokemon once it has been caught such as breeding, EV training and using items such as nature mints, tera shards, dynamax candies and more in order to transform it into the "perfect pokemon".
