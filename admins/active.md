# Active Servers List

The official website has a live [list](https://pokecord.org/active) of discord servers that allows competitive players to explore new places to battle and trade with others. The `Catch` and `Walk Away` buttons are the only two interactions on the bot that can bump a server to the top of the list. 
:::tip
The Server is only bumped if one or more Pok√©mon gain [experience](../strategies/levelup.html).

## Registration
Registering an invite link to the servers is a manual process and requires an administrator of the server to get in touch with the team. By default, an unregistered server always leads to the official server.
:::info
The server must meet our eligibility criteria of a minimum age of `6` months and a minimum member count of `100`.
