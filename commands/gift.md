# Gifting

This command is used to gift pokemon to other trainers. Gifting comes with a few exceptions as some pokemon and items are non transferable.
:::details
All fusions such as `Kyurem Black` and items like `Z-Crystals` and `Mega Stones` cannot be traded or gifted. Adding them to the list for gifting or trading does not display an error message but simply disables the confirm button.

## Releasing Into The Wild

This is a lesser known feature of this command that allows releasing a pokemon into the wild for other players to fight and catch.<br>
The `Spawn` button appears if the command is used without specifying a user and a single pokemon is added to the gift list.
:::tip
- The spawned pokemon message times out in `60` seconds. You cannot fight your own pokemon.
- There can only be one global spawn in a channel at one time.
