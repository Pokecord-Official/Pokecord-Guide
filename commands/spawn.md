# Spawning

This command is used to spawn up to 5 to 6 wild Pokémon at a time. Users can select one to fight and upon winning, choose to either `Catch` it or `Walk Away`. Both interactions yield experience points, effort value points and happiness for the Pokémon that participated in the battle.
:::details
- Caught Pokémon are auto added to the party if there's an empty slot available.
- Spawned Pokémon levels depend on the max leveled Pokémon in the party and are capped at 45.
- Catching requires pokeballs, if the user runs out, the catch button is disabled. Pokeballs can be purchased from the [shop](/commands/shop.html).

:::tip
If you're just starting out, it is recommended to pick your opponent based on [type disvantage](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type) for the best chance at winning.
