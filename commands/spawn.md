# Spawning

This command is used to spawn up to 5 to 6 wild pokemon at a time. Users can select one to fight and upon winning, choose to either `Catch` it or `Walk Away`. Both interactions yield experience points and effort value points.
:::info
Catching requires pokeballs, if the user runs out of pokeballs, the catch button is disabled.
