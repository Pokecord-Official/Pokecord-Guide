# Hangmon

Hangmon is a pokemon minigame where players must guess the correct pokemon based on the provided stats within `6` attempts. Each correct guess narrows down the options until the pokemon is identified. The winner gets to keep the pokemon along with some additional rewards.<br>
Unlike [/spawn](../commands/spawn.md), this game does not follow rarity-based logic, giving players a much higher chance of encountering rare pokemon.
:::info
This game requires `1` pokeball which is consumed after receiving a pokemon.

:::tip
Guessing the pokemon in fewer attempts gives better rewards.
