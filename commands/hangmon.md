# Hangmon

Hangmon is a Pokémon minigame where players must guess the correct Pokémon based on the provided stats within `6` attempts. Each correct guess narrows down the options until the Pokémon is identified. The winner gets to keep the Pokémon along with some additional rewards.<br>
Unlike [/spawn](../commands/spawn.md), this game does not follow rarity-based logic, giving players a much higher chance of encountering rare Pokémon.
:::info
Hangmon requires `1` pokeball which is consumed after receiving a Pokémon.

:::tip
Guessing the Pokémon in fewer attempts gives better rewards.
