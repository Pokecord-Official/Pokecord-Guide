# Viewing Pok√©mon

This is an all in one command that is used to quickly view and edit your Pok√©mon. In addition, this command allows the user to edit the party, select a Pok√©mon, release a Pok√©mon, give or take items and add or remove a Pok√©mon from the [market](./market.md).
:::tip
The very first select menu is used to select a Pok√©mon while the rest of the menus are used to perform actions on the selected Pok√©mon.

Search can contain keywords for rarities like `legendary`, `mythical`, `ultrabeast`, `paradox` and `special` or simply `rare` in addition to Pok√©mon names and dex numbers.
