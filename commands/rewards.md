# Reward Tickets

This command is used to redeem items and pokecoins in exchange for reward tickets. Tickets can be obtained through [voting](../strategies//voting.md), [quests](./daily.md) and other jackpots throughout the bot.

## Ticket Rates

Rewards are categorized into three rarities, `Common`, `Legendary` and `Mythical`. Every ticket can pick items from any rarity but the roll rate differs between each ticket. The `Cosmic Ticket` has the best chance for more rare items followed by the `Master Ticket` and the `Basic Ticket`. 

:::tip
Both `Cosmic Ticket` and `Master Ticket` guarantee at least one rare item.

## Vote Ticket

The `Vote Ticket` has a fixed reward with a chance for a jackpot which activates the [Rare Element](../items.md#rare-element). More information about vote rewards can be found in the [voting](../strategies//voting.md) section.
