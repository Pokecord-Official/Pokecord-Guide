# Profile

This command is used to display a basic overview about the trainer along with information about `region`, `time`, `day`, `weather` and `moon phase` which are used for breeding and evolutions.

## Last Active Status

The last active status indicates when the trainer profile was last updated.
This value is updated after various interactions such as battles, breeding, shop transactions, catching or walking away after winning a spawn battle or [voting](../strategies/voting.md) for the bot on Top.gg.

## Badges

The icons displayed when viewing the trainer profile are called achievement badges. Users can earn badges by completing certain tasks in the bot. These tasks are always kept up to date in the [badges](../strategies/badges.html) section.

## Key Items

[Key items](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Key_Item) are items that have a global effect on all Pok√©mon. These items cannot be used directly and appear in a select menu at the bottom of the profile message.
