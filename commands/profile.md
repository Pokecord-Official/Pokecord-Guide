# Profile

This command is used to display a basic overview about the trainer along with information about `region`, `time`, `weather` and `moon phase` which are used for evolving pokemon.

## Last Active Status

The last active status indicates when the trainer profile was last updated.
This value only updates when the trainer catches or walks away after winning a spawn battle or votes for the bot on Top.gg.

## Badges

The icons displayed when viewing the trainer profile are called achievement badges. Users can earn badges by completing certain tasks in the bot. These tasks are always kept up to date in the bot's `/help` command.

## Active Key Items

Key items are items that have a global effect on all pokemon.  These items appear in a select menu at the bottom of the profile message indicating that they're active.
