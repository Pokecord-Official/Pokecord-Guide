# Gyms

Gyms are special battle arenas where trainers can test their skills against other player's parties and earn prestige as a Gym Leader.

## Eligibility

To fight or claim a gym, you must have a minimum of `15` AI battle win streak. This ensures that only experienced trainers can compete for gym leadership.
