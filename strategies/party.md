# Pokémon Party

There are two party slots that can be viewed using the [view](../commands/view.md) command. Each party slot has it's own selected Pokémon. The selected Pokémon is always displayed at the top of the party list.

## Spawn Party

Pokémon in this section are used for [spawn](../commands/spawn.md) battles. This party has an [Effort Value](./ev.md) cap, meaning once a Pokémon reaches max EVs, it can no longer be used here. This ensures a continuous rotation of different Pokémon.

## Battle Party

Pokémon in this section are used for all battles except spawn battles. There are no restrictions here, making it the ideal place for fully EV-trained Pokémon from the Spawn Party.
