# Active Servers List

The official website has a live [list](https://pokecord.org/active) of discord servers that allows competitive players to explore new places to battle and trade with others. The `Catch` and `Walk Away` buttons are the only two interactions on the bot that are used to bump a server to the top of the list. 
:::info
Registering an invite link to the servers is a manual process and requires an administrator of the server to get in touch with our team. By default, an unregistered server always leads to the official server.
