# EV Training

EVs or [effort value](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Effort_values) points are stat poins that your pokemon gains from defeating other pokemon. Proper EV training can be a deciding factor between winning or losing a battle. A pokemon can have a total of `510` EVs with a max of `252` EVs per stat. Information about the EV yield of each pokemon can be found in the [/info](/commands/info.html) command.
