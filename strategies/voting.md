# Voting On Top.gg
Top.gg is one of the most popular third-party Discord bot listing websites, allowing developers to showcase their projects. Bots with more votes are displayed closer to the top making them easier to find. <br>Voting is free and involves visiting the [listing page](https://top.gg/bot/818836234104602635/vote) of the bot and clicking the `Vote` button. Users can vote once every `12` hours.

## Rewards
We've made sure our users get rewarded for supporting the project. Voting for the bot gives a [Vote Ticket](../commands/rewards.md#vote-ticket) that can be redeemed to obtain certain items and pokecoins. Below are the rewards that can be obtained through voting.
:::warning Notice
Vote reward notifications are sent via direct messages. Users with their DMs disabled won't receive any notifications.

## Streaks
Maintaining a voting streak unlocks better rewards with tickets. The highest-tier rewards include powerful items like the [Shiny Rare Element](../items.md#shiny-rare-element) and [Relics](../items.md#relics), making streaks one of the key methods of earning the best rewards in the bot.
