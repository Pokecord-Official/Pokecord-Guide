# Leveling Up

The leveling system and [experience](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Experience) gain is accurate to the actual pokemon games. The only way to level up your pokemon is through battles or using an item called `Rare Candy`.

## Battles

Experience and effort values can only be obtained through staked battles, spawn battles and AI trainer battles. Each pokemon yields a specific amount of experience points that can be viewed using the `/info` command.

`Blissey` yields the highest amount of experience points.
