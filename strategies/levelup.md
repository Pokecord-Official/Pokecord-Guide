# Leveling Up

The leveling system and [experience](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Experience) gain is accurate to the actual Pokémon games. The only way to level up your Pokémon is through battles or using an item called [Rare Candy](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Rare_Candy).
:::tip
Selling Pokémon on the [market](../commands/market.html) is the best way to obtain free rare candies.

## Battles

Experience and effort value points can only be obtained through staked battles, spawn battles and AI trainer battles. Each Pokémon yields a specific amount of experience and effort value points that can be viewed using the [/info](/commands/info.html) command.

[Blissey](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Blissey_(Pok%C3%A9mon)) yields the highest amount of experience points.
