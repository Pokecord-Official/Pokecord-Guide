# Leveling Up

The leveling system and [experience](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Experience) gain is accurate to the actual Pokémon games. The only way to level up your Pokémon is through battles or using an item called [Rare Candy](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Rare_Candy). Leveling up also increases the happiness value of the Pokémon.

## Battles

Defeating each Pokémon in a battle yields a specific amount of experience and effort value points, this can be viewed using the [/info](/commands/info.html) command.
:::tip
The experience yield for some Pokémon has been edited for balancing purposes. This is indicated by the `[Balanced]` tag in the `/info` command.
