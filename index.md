# About

Pokecord++ is a discord bot designed for users who are willing to learn or play around with actual Pokémon mechanics. Unlike most other discord-based Pokémon experiences, Pokecord++ is more focused towards Pokémon battles as opposed to collection. 

## Adding The Bot

You can invite Pokecord++ to your Discord server using the `+` button on the home page or the `Add` button above this guide. Alternatively, server admins can use the following methods:

- [Discord App Directory](https://discord.com/application-directory/818836234104602635)
- [OAuth2 Invite Link](https://pokecord.org/add)

## Getting Started

- If it's your first time using the bot, using any command will trigger a welcome message with a list of starter Pokémon. The select menu with starter Pokémon can have multiple pages to scroll through.
- Clicking on the Pokémon displays some basic information about it. Once you've made a choice, click the `Select` button to receive your first Pokémon.

:::info
Pokecord++ is designed to only support discord slash commands and does not offer support for @mention or prefix commands.
