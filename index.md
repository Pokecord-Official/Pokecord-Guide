# About

Pokecord++ is a discord bot designed for users who are willing to learn or play around with actual pokemon mechanics. Unlike most other discord-based pokemon experiences, Pokecord++ is more focused towards pokemon battles as opposed to collection. 

## Getting Started

- Pokecord++ is designed to only support discord slash commands and does not offer support for @mention or prefix commands.<br>
- If it's your first time using the bot, using any command will trigger a welcome message with a list of starter pokemon. The select menu with starter pokemon can have multiple pages to scroll through.<br>
- Clicking on the pokemon displays some basic information about it. Once you have made a choice, click the `Select` button to receive your first pokemon.

::: info
Commands like `/ping`, `/help` and `/info` do not trigger the welcome message.
