# About The Bot

Pokecord++ is a Discord bot built for users who want to engage with authentic Pokémon mechanics. Unlike most Discord-based Pokémon bots that prioritize collecting, Pokecord++ is centered around strategic battles and competitive gameplay. It rewards players who take the time to learn real battle systems, offering a more skill-based and faithful experience.

# About The Guide

This guide helps users navigate the core features of Pokecord++, explaining how to use the bot effectively. It highlights key mechanics and points out areas where they differ from the official Pokémon games. The guide is written with regular users in mind, so it skips over internal logic, technical details, and backend behavior that aren’t relevant to typical gameplay.

## Adding The Bot

You can invite Pokecord++ to your Discord server using the `+` button on the home page or the `Add` button above this guide. Alternatively, server admins can use the following methods:

- [Discord App Directory](https://discord.com/application-directory/818836234104602635)
- [OAuth2 Invite Link](https://pokecord.org/add)

## Getting Started

- If it's your first time using the bot, using any command will trigger a welcome message with a list of starter Pokémon. The select menu with starter Pokémon can have multiple pages to scroll through.
- Clicking on the Pokémon displays some basic information about it. Once you've made a choice, click the `Select` button to receive your first Pokémon.
