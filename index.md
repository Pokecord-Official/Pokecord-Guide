# About

Pokecord++ is a discord bot designed for users who are willing to learn or play around with actual Pokémon mechanics. Unlike most other discord-based Pokémon experiences, Pokecord++ is more focused towards Pokémon battles as opposed to collection. 

## Getting Started

- If it's your first time using the bot, using any command will trigger a welcome message with a list of starter Pokémon. The select menu with starter Pokémon can have multiple pages to scroll through.
- Clicking on the Pokémon displays some basic information about it. Once you have made a choice, click the `Select` button to receive your first Pokémon.

:::info
Pokecord++ is designed to only support discord slash commands and does not offer support for @mention or prefix commands.

::: tip
Commands like `/ping`, `/help` and `/info` do not trigger the welcome message.
